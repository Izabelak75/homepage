# About Me Website

This is my first personal website created as part of my learning journey in **Fundamentals of Web Development**. 
It presents information about my **passions**, **favorite books**, and a small **JavaScript interaction** that I built myself.

##  Project Overview

The website is a simple one-page project built using:
- **HTML** for structure 
- **CSS** for styling 
- **JavaScript** for interactivity 

It is an informational website dedicated to me — a creative person passionate about art, handcraft, and reading inspiring books.

The language of the page is **Polish**.

- Navigation menu linking to each main section 
- Table displaying my favorite books 
- A JavaScript button that changes text and color when clicked

##  Functionality

##  My Passions

I have been interested in **art and handcraft** since childhood. 
I love combining **painting with textile techniques** such as embroidery and knitting. 
Creating something beautiful from simple materials is my way to express thoughts and emotions. 
Nature and changing colors of seasons inspire my work. 

In addition to art, I enjoy reading **motivational, business, and psychological books** that help me grow and find inspiration for new projects.
